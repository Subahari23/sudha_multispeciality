          A branch of medicine dealing with disorders of heart and blood
          vessels. The work of our cardiologists for adults includes diagnosis
          and treatment of adult congenital heart disease, heart failure,
          coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease and arrhythmias. All
          the necessary investigations like ECG, Echocardiogram, Treadmill test,
          Holter monitoring, Ambulatory BP monitoring, tilt table testing,
          cardiac CT, cardiac MRI, and nuclear heart scanning are available to
          provide you with the best adult cardiology treatment at our
          multispeciality hospital in Erode.

          Diagnostic Tests Available in our Cardiology Hospital:
        </h4>
        <h2 className="font-semibold text-[#2B3990]">ECG:</h2>
        <p>
          Cardiac problems such as heart attack, heart block, etc. can be
          detected by measuring the electrical activity of the heart, which is
          done by electrocardiogram (ECG).
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-semibold text-[#2B3990]">ECHOCARDIOGRAM:</h2>
        <p>
          The structure and function of the heart can be assessed by moving
          images produced by sound waves. Various heart diseases can be
          diagnosed by this readily available investigation.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-semibold text-[#2B3990]">TREADMILL TEST:</h2>
        <p>
          Patients will walk on a treadmill at graded levels and their 12- lead
          ECG will be monitored for heart rate, ST-T segment changes. The
          presence or absence of changes will be interpreted accordingly to
          detect heart problems like coronary artery disease, heart block,
          etc..., that helps in determining the cardiology treatment that is to
          proceed further accordingly.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-semibold text-[#2B3990]">
          STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY:
        </h2>
        <p>
          Heart is exerted by exercise or medicines and its activity is
          monitored by echocardiography. For those who are not able to walk to
          perform treadmill test, this is a very useful test to rule out
          coronary artery disease.
