        <p className="text-[15px]">
          We also offer advanced structural heart disease interventions, including Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), along with other catheter-based procedures such as Balloon Mitral Valvotomy (BMV), Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR), Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR), renal artery stenting, and subclavian artery stenting. These procedures are carried out with high success rates, enabling most patients to return home within a day or two without complications.

        </h4>
        <h2 className="font-semibold text-[#2B3990]">ECG:</h2>
        <p>
          Cardiac problems such as heart attack, heart block, etc. can be
          detected by measuring the electrical activity of the heart, which is
          done by electrocardiogram (ECG).
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-semibold text-[#2B3990]">ECHOCARDIOGRAM:</h2>
        <p>
          The structure and function of the heart can be assessed by moving
          images produced by sound waves. Various heart diseases can be
          diagnosed by this readily available investigation.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-semibold text-[#2B3990]">TREADMILL TEST:</h2>
        <p>
          Patients will walk on a treadmill at graded levels and their 12- lead
          ECG will be monitored for heart rate, ST-T segment changes. The
          presence or absence of changes will be interpreted accordingly to
          detect heart problems like coronary artery disease, heart block,
          etc..., that helps in determining the cardiology treatment that is to
          proceed further accordingly.

        <h2 className="font-semibold text-[#2B3990]">
          STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY:
        </h2>
        <p>
          Heart is exerted by exercise or medicines and its activity is
          monitored by echocardiography. For those who are not able to walk to
          perform treadmill test, this is a very useful test to rule out
          coronary artery disease.
